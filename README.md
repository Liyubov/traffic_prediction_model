# traffic prediction model
Traffic prediction models based on various types of models.

Basic set of models for predictions

Other set of models

1 T-GCN is the source codes for the paper named “T-GCN: A Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Prediction” published in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS) which forged the T-GCN model the spatial and temporal dependence simultaneously.

2 AST-GCN is the source codes for the paper named “AST-GCN: Attribute-Augmented Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Forecasting” published in IEEE Access which strengthen the T-GCN model model with attribute information.

3 DFD-GCN https://github.com/GestaltCogTeam/DFDGCN/tree/main/DFDGCN 

We are updating and adding various 
- structural features of graph
- temporal features of graph such as listed here https://github.com/romanroff/ITMO_subjects/blob/main/NIR/utils/features.py
